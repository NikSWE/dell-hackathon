3. User should also be recommended within the price range they have been searching on the other websites.
4. User should also be prompted with other gadgets that can go along with the recommendation.
5. User should also be given chance to browse other products if the recommended products are not added to cart.
6. User should be given a comments box to enter the reason for not purchasing recommended products (this will help further refine the AI engine).
